✨ Features

Glassmorphism Design: Utilizes backdrop-blur, semi-transparent layers, and CSS gradients for a high-end, modern look.

Full Keyboard Support: Interactive with physical keyboards (numbers, operators, enter for equals, and backspace).

History Tracking: Displays the current operation in a secondary "previous operand" view for better user context.

Precision Logic: Handles floating-point arithmetic accurately to prevent common binary rounding errors.

Mobile Optimized: Fully responsive grid layout that adjusts button sizes for touch devices.

🛠️ Technical Stack

HTML5: Semantic markup for accessibility and structure.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling for layout and responsive design.

Custom CSS: Specialized styling for Glassmorphism effects and button transitions.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): Logic for arithmetic operations, state management, and keyboard event listeners.
